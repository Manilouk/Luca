# Lucas

I am a chemist with an MSc in Computational Chemistry and currently a PhD researcher
working on Machine Learning and Deep Learning applications for Metal–Organic
Frameworks (MOFs). My academic work focuses on molecular simulations, data analysis,
and building Python tools for handling and interpreting scientific datasets.

Beyond computational chemistry, I am actively developing broader programming skills,
including Python for general-purpose projects, introductory backend concepts, and
fundamentals of data processing. My experience so far is mostly academic rather than
professional, but I am steadily expanding my abilities through bootcamps, personal
projects, and continuous practice.

This GitHub reflects my learning path and the work I’ve been doing to strengthen my
programming foundation while integrating it with my scientific background.
